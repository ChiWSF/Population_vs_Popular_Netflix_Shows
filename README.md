# Population vs Popular Netflix Shows
Our world is very connected through the internet so a lot of businesses are very international, especially streaming services. Streaming companies are making shows more diverse in order to appeal to a global audience. More people watching a show mean that kind of show can draw more subscriptions.
However, there are complaints like making a diverse show is just pushing a "woke agenda". Here, I'm using data from Netflix (a global streaming company) to prove that making a diverse show isn't driven by a "woke agenda", it's in fact driven by popularity.
I listed the top 100 shows by the cumulative weekly hours viewed. Then I compared the most popular shows with different demographics/countries to the population of the world with the associated demographic/country.
The result shows that diverse shows are drawing more viewership than a typical mostly White American lead shows. This proves that the agenda isn't to push a certain demographic/country, it's just the agenda about attracting more subscriptions globally.
