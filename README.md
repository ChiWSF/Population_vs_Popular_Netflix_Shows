# Population vs Popular Netflix Shows
Our world is very connected through the internet so that a lot of buisnesses are very internetional, expecially for streaming servises.
Streaming companies are making shows more diverse in order to appeal to the golbal audience.
More people watching a shows mean that kind of show can draw more subscriptions.

However, there are complains like making a diverse show is just pushing a "woke agenda".
Here, I'm using data from Netflix (a golbal streaming company) to prove that making a diverse show isn't driven by "woke agenda", it's in fact driven by popularity.

I listed the top 100 shows by the cumulative weekly hours viewed.
Then I compared the most popular shows with different demongraphics/country to the population of the world with the associated demongraphic/country.

The result shows that diverse shows are drawing more viwership than a typical mostly White Americans lead shows.
This proves that the agenda isn't to push a certain demongraphic/country, it's just the agenda about attracting more subscription golbally.
